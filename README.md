# Base Jekyll

This repository is intended for you to use as you follow along with [Jekyll's Step by Step Tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). It's essentially an empty workspace, but it has a few Jekyll-related gems (see the `Gemfile` for a list) pre-installed to save you time. You may have to install others if you want to experiment with additional plugins.
